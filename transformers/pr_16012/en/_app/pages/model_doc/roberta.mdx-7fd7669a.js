study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and
training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every
model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results
