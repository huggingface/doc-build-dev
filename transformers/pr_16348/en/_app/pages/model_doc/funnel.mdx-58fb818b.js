much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only
require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which
gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More
importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further
improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining
objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence
via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on

much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only
require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which
gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More
importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further
improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining
objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence
via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on
