trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource
languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing

outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +13.8% average accuracy on
XNLI, +12.3% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.1% average F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on
low-resource languages, improving 11.8% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 9.2% for Urdu over the previous XLM model. We
also present a detailed empirical evaluation of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the
trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource
languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing
per-language performance; XLM-Ris very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We
