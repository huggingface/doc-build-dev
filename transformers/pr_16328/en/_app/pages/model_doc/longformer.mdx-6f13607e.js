mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or
longer. Longformer\u2019s attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local
windowed attention with a task motivated global attention. Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we
evaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8. In
contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer and finetune it on a variety of downstream tasks. Our

evaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8. In
