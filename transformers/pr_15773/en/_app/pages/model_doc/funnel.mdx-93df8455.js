much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only
require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which
gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More
importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further
improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining
objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence
via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on

scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the
much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only
require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which
gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More
importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further
improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining
objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence
via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on
a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading
