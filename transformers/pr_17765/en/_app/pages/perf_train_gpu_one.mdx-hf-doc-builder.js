Sometimes, even when applying all the above tweaks the throughput on a given GPU might still not be good enough. One easy solution is to change the type of GPU. For example switching from let's say a K80 (which you typically get on Google Colab) to a fancier GPU such as the V100 or A100. Although they are more expensive they are usually more cost effective than cheaper GPUs due to their larger memory and faster architecture.

TorchDynamo is a new tracer that uses Python\u2019s frame evaluation API to automatically create FX traces from existing PyTorch programs. After capturing the FX graph, different backends can be deployed to lower to an optimized engine. One solution is using the [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) or NVFuser as backend. You can choose one option below for performance boost.
