<h1 id="optimum">ü§ó Optimum</h1>

ü§ó Optimum is an extension of ü§ó Transformers, providing a set of performance optimization tools enabling maximum efficiency to train and run models on targeted hardware.

The AI ecosystem evolves quickly and more and more specialized hardware along with their own optimizations are emerging every day.
As such, Optimum enables users to efficiently use any of these platforms with the same ease inherent to transformers.


<h2 id="integration-with-hardware-partners">Integration with Hardware Partners</h2>

ü§ó Optimum aims at providing more diversity towards the kind of hardware users can target to train and finetune their models.

To achieve this, we are collaborating with the following hardware manufacturers in order to provide the best transformers integration:
- [Graphcore IPUs](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore) - IPUs are a completely new kind of massively parallel processor to accelerate machine intelligence. [More information here](https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu).
- [Habana Gaudi Processor (HPU)](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana) - [HPUs](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Gaudi_Overview/Gaudi_Architecture.html) are designed to maximize training throughput and efficiency. [More information here](https://habana.ai/training/).
- [Intel](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel) - Enabling the usage of Intel tools to accelerate end-to-end pipelines on Intel architectures. More information [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html).
- More to come soon! ‚≠ê

<h2 id="optimizing-models-towards-inference">Optimizing models towards inference</h2>

Along with supporting dedicated AI hardware for training, Optimum also provides inference optimizations towards various frameworks and
platforms.

Optimum enables the usage of popular compression techniques such as quantization and pruning by supporting [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/) along with Intel [Neural Compressor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) (INC).

|              Features              | ONNX Runtime  | Intel Neural Compressor |

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

ü§ó Optimum can be installed using `pip` as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install optimum
```

If you'd like to use the accelerator-specific features of ü§ó Optimum, you can install the required dependencies according to the table below:

| Accelerator                                                                                                            | Installation                                 |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| [ONNX runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/)                                                                           | `python -m pip install optimum[onnxruntime]` |
| [Intel Neural Compressor (INC)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) | `python -m pip install optimum[intel]`       |
| [Graphcore IPU](https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu)                                                                 | `python -m pip install optimum[graphcore]`   |
| [Habana Gaudi Processor (HPU)](https://habana.ai/training/)                                                            | `python -m pip install optimum[habana]`      |


If you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for a new release, you can install the base library from source as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```

For the acclerator-specific features, you can install them by appending `#egg=optimum[accelerator_type]` to the `pip` command, e.g.

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git#egg=optimum[onnxruntime]
```
